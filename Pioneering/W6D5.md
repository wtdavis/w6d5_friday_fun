## Controller Rendering

- View : JSON, HTML
- Syntax: render template
- render: show
---

Renders at yield

```ruby
render :edit
render template: "books/edit"
render template: "books/edit.html.erb"

# <% non printing %> 
# <%= printing code %>

```

- show.html.erb (This is example file name)

## Things to remember about ERB code

- ERB code is not visible to the client/browser.
- Don't try to run or print
- Comment out by putting <%#> or <%=#>

## Debugging

- Use byebug
- Stack trace is a great feature, look at it
- binding_of_caller and better_errors

## Partials

- The key that you use will be used for the partial
- To keep the code dry

## new and edit routes

- HTML/ERB template to create or update an instance of data

## Form Anatomy

1. action
2. HTPPP method (ex:POST)
3. inputs with labels (optional)
4. submit button

# Controller redirecting
- Ends current request /response cycle and initializes a second

    - syntax: redirect_to \<rails URL Helper>
